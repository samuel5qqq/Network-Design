Design a basic network topology by given the unit cost and traffic demand between every pairs of nodes. Implement the shortest path based fast solution method to find the optimal path that have the minimum cost.

Input: 
- Number of Nodes
- Traffic demand values (b_ij)
- Unit costs for potential links (a_ij)

Output: 
A network topology with minimum cost between every pair of node based on different K, where K = 3, 4, â€¦, 15.
